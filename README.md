Project Overview
This is a Luxury Watch Target Price Evaluation Tool that allows users to input a watch reference number and receive target purchase pricing information. The application is built as a React/TypeScript web application with the following key characteristics:

Core Functionality
Watch Reference Input: Users enter luxury watch reference numbers (e.g., "116500LN" - likely a Rolex model)
Price Analysis: The app provides:
Target Buy Price: The recommended purchase price
Market Average: Current market pricing
Confidence Level: High/Medium/Low confidence in the evaluation
Technical Architecture
Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
Styling: TailwindCSS with custom color scheme (luxury theme with colors like "champagne-gold", "money-green", "platinum-silver")
UI Components: Custom components with smooth animations and professional styling
State Management: Currently using local React state (has Redux setup for future expansion)
Current Implementation Status
Simulated Backend: Currently uses mock API responses with randomized pricing data
No Real API: The handleEvaluate function simulates a 2.5-second API call with mock data
Error Handling: Basic error states for empty input and test error scenarios
Deployment Configuration
Target Platform: Render.com (as you mentioned)
Build Setup: Configured for both development and production deployment
Backend Ready: Package.json shows scripts for backend integration (backend:dev, backend:start)
Visual Design
Premium Aesthetic: Dark theme with gold accents, giving it a luxury watch market feel
Animated Background: Subtle floating gradients for visual appeal
Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly layout
Loading States: Professional loading spinner and transitions
Intended Use Case
This app is designed for luxury watch dealers, collectors, or enthusiasts who need quick market analysis to make informed purchasing decisions.
