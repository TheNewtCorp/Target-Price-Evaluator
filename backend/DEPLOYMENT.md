# üöÄ Render.com Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Files Ready for Deployment:

- [x] `package.json` - Updated with Playwright dependencies
- [x] `server.js` - Production-ready Express server
- [x] `playwrightChrono24Service.js` - Enhanced headless service
- [x] `Dockerfile` - Playwright-optimized container
- [x] `healthcheck.js` - Health monitoring
- [x] `render.yaml` - Render.com configuration
- [x] `.env.example` - Environment template
- [x] `.gitignore` - Clean repository
- [x] `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Environment Variables for Render.com:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
HEADLESS=true
LOG_LEVEL=info
ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING=false
MIN_DELAY_MS=1500
MAX_DELAY_MS=4000
SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS=300000
```

## üìã Render.com Setup Steps

1. **Create New Web Service**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the `/backend` folder as root directory

2. **Build & Deploy Settings**

   ```
   Build Command: npm install && npx playwright install chromium
   Start Command: npm start
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Add all variables from the list above
   - Ensure `HEADLESS=true` for production

4. **Advanced Settings**
   ```
   Health Check Path: /health
   Auto-Deploy: Yes (from main branch)
   ```

## üîß Service Configuration

### Resource Requirements:

- **Plan**: Starter ($7/month) or Professional ($25/month)
- **Memory**: ~512MB minimum (1GB recommended)
- **CPU**: Standard (Playwright is CPU intensive)
- **Region**: Choose closest to target users

### Expected Performance:

- **Cold Start**: ~30-60 seconds (Playwright installation)
- **Warm Response**: ~45-60 seconds per evaluation
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ with anti-detection measures

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- [x] No sensitive data in repository
- [x] Environment variables for configuration
- [x] Non-root Docker user
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] Error handling without data exposure
- [x] CORS properly configured

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### Health Checks:

- Render.com will automatically monitor `/health` endpoint
- Service will restart if health checks fail
- Monitor logs through Render.com dashboard

### Key Metrics to Watch:

- Response times (should be 45-60s)
- Memory usage (keep under service limits)
- Error rates (should be <5%)
- Browser initialization time

## üö® Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Browser not found"

**Solution**: Ensure `npx playwright install chromium` runs in build command

### Issue: "Out of memory"

**Solution**: Upgrade to Professional plan or optimize browser args

### Issue: "Timeout during evaluation"

**Solution**: Check if site is blocking or increase timeout values

### Issue: "CORS errors"

**Solution**: Update CORS origins in `server.js` with actual frontend URLs

## üîÑ Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Health Check**: `GET https://your-service.onrender.com/health`
2. **API Test**: Send POST request to `/api/evaluate` with test reference number
3. **Performance**: Verify response times are acceptable
4. **Logging**: Check Render.com logs for any errors
5. **Frontend Integration**: Update frontend API endpoints

## üìù Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:

- Monitor service logs weekly
- Check for Playwright updates monthly
- Review error rates and performance metrics
- Update dependencies as needed

### Scaling Considerations:

- Current setup handles moderate traffic
- For high volume, consider multiple instances
- Database caching could improve repeat queries
- CDN for static assets if needed

## üìû Support

If deployment fails:

1. Check Render.com build logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure GitHub repository is accessible
4. Review this checklist for missed steps
